## Why Refactoring and Design Patterns Matter

### The Cost of Poor Code

<Aside type="danger" title="Maintenance Nightmares">
Poorly written code is harder to debug, extend, and maintain. It slows down development and increases costs.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Technical Debt">
Every shortcut or "quick fix" adds to your technical debt, which eventually must be paid—with interest.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Team Productivity">
Clean, well-structured code makes it easier for teams to collaborate and onboard new members.

## Example: Before and After Refactoring

```javascript
// Before: Messy, hard-to-read code
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price * items[i].quantity;
  }
  return total;
}
```

```javascript
// After: Clean, refactored code
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}
```
