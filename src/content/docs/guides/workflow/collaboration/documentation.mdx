# Documentation

Good documentation is **essential** for maintaining a healthy codebase and onboarding new team members. It ensures that everyone understands how the code works, why decisions were made, and how to use it effectively.

---

## Why Documentation Matters

- **Onboarding**: Helps new team members get up to speed quickly.
- **Maintenance**: Makes it easier to understand and update code.
- **Collaboration**: Ensures everyone is on the same page.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Preserves institutional knowledge.

## Best Practices for Writing Documentation

<Steps>
    1. **Keep It Concise**
    Avoid unnecessary details. Focus on what’s important for the reader.
    2. **Update Regularly**
    Documentation should evolve with the code. Outdated docs are worse than no docs.
    3. **Use Examples**
    Show how to use the code or feature with practical examples.
    4. **Write for Your Audience**
    Tailor the documentation to the intended readers (e.g., developers, end-users).
    5. **Automate When Possible**
    Use tools like JSDoc, Swagger, or Docusaurus to generate documentation automatically.
</Steps>

## Tools for Documentation

| Tool               | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Markdown**       | Simple, readable format for writing documentation.                     |
| **Docusaurus**     | Build and maintain open-source documentation websites.                |
| **Swagger/OpenAPI**| Generate interactive API documentation.                               |
| **JSDoc**          | Document JavaScript code with annotations.                            |
| **Confluence**     | Collaborate on documentation with your team.                          |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Outdated documentation**: Always update docs when the code changes.
- **Overcomplicating**: Keep it simple and focused.
- **Ignoring the audience**: Write for the people who will use the documentation.
- **Lack of examples**: Show, don’t just tell.

---

## Next Steps

- Start with a **README** for your project.
- Use **automated tools** to generate and maintain documentation.
- Encourage your team to **contribute to and review** documentation.
