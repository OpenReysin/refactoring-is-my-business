# Pair Programming

Pair programming is a **collaborative practice** where two developers work together at one workstation. One writes code (the **driver**), while the other reviews each line (the **navigator**). The roles can switch frequently.

---

## Why Pair Programming?

- **Improves code quality**: Two sets of eyes catch more bugs and edge cases.
- **Shares knowledge**: Helps team members learn from each other.
- **Encourages teamwork**: Fosters collaboration and communication.
- **Reduces knowledge silos**: Ensures that more than one person understands the code.

## Best Practices for Pair Programming

<Steps>
    1. **Set Clear Goals**
    Define what you want to achieve in the session (e.g., fix a bug, implement a feature).
    2. **Communicate Openly**
    Discuss ideas, ask questions, and explain your thought process.
    3. **Take Breaks**
    Pair programming can be intense. Take short breaks to stay fresh.
    4. **Rotate Pairs**
    Work with different team members to share knowledge widely.
    5. **Use the Right Tools**
    For remote pairing, use tools like VS Code Live Share, Tuple, or JetBrains Code With Me.

## Common Challenges

- **Fatigue**: Pair programming can be mentally tiring. Take breaks and switch partners.
- **Personality clashes**: Not everyone works well together. Rotate pairs to find good fits.
- **Remote difficulties**: Use high-quality tools to minimize lag and communication issues.

---

## Next Steps

- Start with short pair programming sessions (e.g., 30-60 minutes).
- Encourage your team to try pair programming for complex tasks.
- Use tools that make remote pairing seamless.
