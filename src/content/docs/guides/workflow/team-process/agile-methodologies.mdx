# Agile Methodologies

Agile methodologies are **iterative and incremental** approaches to software development. They emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and delivering small, functional pieces of software frequently.

---

## Why Agile?

- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing requirements and priorities.
- **Customer focus**: Deliver value to customers early and often.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage teamwork and communication.

## Scrum vs. Kanban

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Scrum">
        - **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
        - **Ceremonies**: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Retrospective.
        - **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.
        - **Timeboxed**: Work is divided into fixed-length sprints (e.g., 2 weeks).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Kanban">
        - **Visual Workflow**: Uses a Kanban board to visualize work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
        - **Continuous Flow**: Work items are pulled as capacity allows, no fixed iterations.
        - **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: Focus on completing tasks before starting new ones.
        - **Flexible**: Adapt to changing priorities without disrupting the flow.
