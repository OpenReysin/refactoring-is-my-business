## Categories of Design Patterns

Design Patterns are typically categorized into three main groups:



| Category          | Description                                                                 | Examples                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creational**    | Simplify object creation.                                                   | Singleton, Factory Method, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory          |
| **Structural**    | Facilitate class and object composition.                                    | Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Composite                             |
| **Behavioral**    | Optimize communication between objects and assign responsibilities.       | Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Iterator, Template Method           |

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Reusability**: Avoid reinventing the wheel.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for complex systems.
- **Communication**: Common language among developers.
